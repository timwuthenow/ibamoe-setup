# Build your own version of the Environment

If you go the build your own container route, you will need to provide the JDBC jar for PostgreSQL that you can use and update the `Dockerfile` found in `docker/support/docker/Dockerfile` on *line 58*. This file, as well as the IBAMOE downloads will need to be added to the `docker/installs` path.

To do the build your own verison:

1. Download IBAMOE from the method provided to you - be it a shared link, Passport Advantage or Fix Central.
1. Move the following files to the `docker/installs` path
   - bamoe-8.0.1-add-ons.zip
   - bamoe-8.0.1-business-central-eap7-deployable.zip
   - bamoe-8.0.1-kie-server-ee8.zip
   - jboss-eap-7.4.0.zip
   - postgresql-42.5.1.jar
   - settings.xml

   1. Swap out the maven.settings file for one that works for your environment
   2. If you want to use a different data source than PostgreSQL, you will need to change the JDBC jar as well as updating the files in `docker/init-properties.sh` *JDBC* and in the `docker/support/docker/Dockerfile` update the lines between this `####UPDATE THIS LINE FOR CHANGING THE DATA SOURCE JDBC PROVIDER TO APPROPRIATE JAR#####` with the appropriate source. Instructions to update `standalone-full.xml` to come later.
1. After the updates have been completed to the files, run from the `docker` directory run `init-docker.sh` which will run through the process of building a customized `Dockerfile` and then build the associative container as ibamoe-8-bc-persistence. If you want to add tags and other pieces to it, you can do so using your preferred methods.
1. Now that the container is built, you can go back to this parent folder and run `docker compose up` and the new environment will be built.

After you put the downloaded files in docker/installs, you can build the Docker container for `ibamoe-8-bc-persistence` by navigating to `cd docker` and then running the script `./init-docker.sh`.
